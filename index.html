                            I'm a passionate hardcore gamer who loves playing almost every type of video game (except horror games like <i>Phasmophobia</i>). I started playing video games at the age of 4. 
                            <i>Warcraft 3</i> and <i>Command & Conquer: Red Alert 2</i> were my first games. When I was in middle school, I was shocked by the incredibly realistic graphics of <i>Crysis 2</i> and <i>Battlefield 3</i>. They sparked my desire to pursue a career in computer graphics.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I'm good at FPS esports games. In <i>Apex Legends</i>, I reached the highest rank, Apex Predator (temporarily achieved the highest ranking of #74); in <i>Valorant</i>, I've solo queued to Diamond; and in <i>Overwatch</i>, I'm a multi-season Master. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Besides esports games, I enjoy narrative-driven games with good storylines, such as <i>Red Dead Redemption 2</i> and <i>Baldur's Gate 3</i>, and ARPG games like <i>Bloodborne</i> and <i>Elden Ring</i>. I also enjoy some lightweight rogue-like (or rogue-lite) games.
                            My favorite game this year is <i><a href="https://www.expedition33.com/" target="_blank">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a></i> , and I believe this game will win the TGA's Game of the Year award.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This love for gaming is what inspired me to choose rendering as my research area. I hope that one day, my research outcome can be widely applied in the video game industry to create the next generation of game graphics.

                    abstract:'Photorealistic rendering aims to accurately replicate real-world appearances. Traditional methods, like microfacet-based models, often struggle with complex visuals. Consequently, neural material techniques have emerged, typically offering improved performance over traditional approaches. However, these neural material approaches only attempt to address one or a few essential aspects of the complete appearance while neglecting others (quality, parallax & silhouette}, synthesis, performance). Although these aspects may seem separate, they are inherently intertwined as part of the complete appearance which cannot be isolated. In this paper, we challenge the comprehensive neural material representation by thoroughly considering the essential aspects of the complete appearance. We introduce an int8-quantized neural network that keeps high fidelity (quality) while achieving an order of magnitude speedup (performance) compared to previous methods. We also present a controllable structure-preserving synthesis strategy (synthesis), along with accurate displacement effects (parallax & silhouette) through a dynamic two-step displacement tracing technique.\n',

                    abstract:'Measured Bidirectional Texture Function (BTF) can faithfully reproduce a realistic appearance but is costly to acquire and store due to its 6D nature (2D spatial and 4D angular). Therefore, it is practical and necessary for rendering to synthesize BTFs from a small example patch. While previous methods managed to produce plausible results, we find that they seldomly take into consideration the property of being dynamic, so a BTF must be synthesized before the rendering process, resulting in limited size, costly pre-generation and storage issues. In this paper, we propose a dynamic BTF synthesis scheme, where a BTF at any position only needs to be synthesized when being queried. Our insight is that, with the recent advances in neural dimension reduction methods, a BTF can be decomposed into disjoint low-dimensional components. We can perform dynamic synthesis only on the positional dimensions, and during rendering, recover the BTF by querying and combining these low-dimensional functions with the help of a lightweight Multilayer Perceptron (MLP). Consequently, we obtain a fully dynamic 6D BTF synthesis scheme that does not require any pre-generation, which enables efficient rendering of our infinitely large and non-repetitive BTFs on the fly. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through various types of BTFs taken from UBO2014.\n',

We first introduce a novel scene representation: ray-aligned occupancy map array (ROMA) that is generated by rasterizing the dynamic scene once per frame. Our key contribution is a fast and low-divergence tracing method computing visibilities in constant time, without constructing and traversing the traditional intersection acceleration data structures such as BVH. To further improve accuracy and reduce aliasing, we use a spatiotemporal scheme to stochastically distribute the candidate ray samples. We demonstrate the practicality of our method by integrating it into a modern real-time renderer and showing better performance compared to existing techniques based on distance fields (DFs). Our method is free of the typical artifacts caused by incomplete scene information, and is about 2.5x–10x faster than generating and tracing DFs at the same resolution and equal storage.\n',
